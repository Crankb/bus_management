## Objectives
- Main objective is to design and develop an automated bus management system to eliminate the need for human conductors hence reduce time taken on transport booking and management by promoting efficiency.

1. To design and develop a Check-out-book module which will record a ticket has been ordered and a sit has been taken.
2. To design and develop a Check-in-book module which will record if a ticket destination has been arrived and a sit is free for booking.
3. To connect the bus management system to an integrated mobile transfer system to be able to identify if a ticket has been payed for.
4. To design and develop an admin module for key bus management operations, e.g. tracking, keeping a record of tickets on demand, tickets off demand, charging clients and communicating them to the respective buses.
5. To develop a database for storing and managing all transport operation records.
6. To synchronize the modules with the database.
7. To build a General Interface that clients and admin staff can use when they come to system Eg. When clients want to book a ticket. When the admins want to see and manage records.

## Software Requirements Specification
1. HTML/CSS - Used to design the frontend side of the software.
2. Javascript - Used to write scripts for controlling frontend side of the software.
3. PHP - The software backed in design and maintained in php.
4. Mysql - The main database system for storing system data.
5. Python - Used for developing the messaging and payment system of the sotfware.
